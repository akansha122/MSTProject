								<br>
								A blessing of God! <br>
								A clean rocky beach with fine silvery white sand</h2>
								<p>
								<b>Ganapatipule</b> Beach Ganapatipule is not like other popular beaches of Maharashtra, which are crowded and polluted! Instead, it is aesthetic and scenic and regarded as one of the best beaches in Maharashtra
 is surrounded by natural splendors like sparkling blue waters, swaying palms, pristine air, white sands, mangroves and coconut palms. Located along the Konkan coast, the Ganapatipule Beach is an idyllic getaway for many tourists who want to experience peace and tranquility through the far stretch of blue Arabian Sea and the white sands.</p>
								<br>
								<p>
								The temple of Swayambhu (self-originated) Ganesh is one of the popular attractions in and around Ganpatipule Beach, which is visited by a lot of tourists every day to pay respect to this great deity. Apart from this, there are various restaurants offering local preparations like Ambapoli (thin pancakes of crushed and dried mango), Phanspoli (thin pancakes of dried and crushed Jackfruit), fish curries, and the Kokam Kadi. The travelers can also visit Malgund village, birthplace of the famous Marathi poet ‘Keshavsut’, to witness the beauty of Shastri River, which has its own peaceful and coconut-fringed beach.</p>
								<br>
								<p>
								Ganapatipule has a tropical climate. It experiences constant weather that nearby cities in and around the district of South India do.

The best time to visit Ganapatipule is between October and March, when the weather is not too hot and humid. The beach town experiences wholesome downpour and low temperatures during monsoons.</p>

								<h2 class="pb-30"> Kashid Beach : <br>
								<br>
								A paradise with <br>
								crystal clear <br>
								and golden sand shores</h2>
								<p>
								<b>Kashid </b> is located almost 30 km from Alibaug and 125 km from Mumbai, Kashid Beach is situated on the coasts of Arabian Sea. Famous for its beautiful clear blue water, white colour sand and cliffs, it is one of the most popular and alluring beaches of Maharashtra. The beach is outstretched across 3 km and surrounded by shrubs and trees called Casuarina, which enhance the natural charms of this destination.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
								One can indulge in watersports, go night camping and enjoy the beautiful night sky or just go for horseriding on the beach. Visit Murud Janjira Fort located at a distance of 20 km from Kashid for a slice of history.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
								Towering up from a massive rock amidst the stretching azure of the Arabian Sea, this fort has stood the test of time as well as the test of resilience in the past. Weekends at Kashid beach are quite crowded so it would be best to visit on weekdays.
                                    
The sun-kissed, white, clean sandy beach with crystalline water offers a dream destination for water-sports enthusiasts. Skim through the frothy waters of the Arabian Sea as you jet ski your way through it, or you can enjoy a quaint boat ride with your family. Parasailing is another activity that you can pursue at the beach. Get a bird's eye view of the beach as you soar high above in a thrilling hot air balloon ride, or you can also trot your way through the beach on the back of a horse! Surfing is another popular activity here and can be pursued during the non-monsoon months when the waves are 5-6 feet high.</p>
